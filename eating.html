                            <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating disorders are real and complex medical and mental health conditions that can have serious consequences for health, productivity, and relationships. Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and OSFED (other specified feeding or eating disorder) are not fads, phases, or lifestyle choices.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People struggling with an eating disorder often become obsessed with food, body image, and/or weight. These disorders can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated appropriately. The earlier a person receives treatment, the greater the likelihood of full recovery.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Types of Eating disorder&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating disorders are a group of related conditions involving extreme food and weight issues, but each disorder has unique symptoms and diagnosis criteria. Here are six of the most common eating disorders&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <ol class="mb-3 ul-list">
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><strong>Anorexia nervosa&nbsp;</strong></p></li>
                                    <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anorexia nervosa is likely the most well-known eating disorder.It generally develops during adolescence or young adulthood and tends to affect more women than men. People with anorexia generally view themselves as overweight, even if they’re dangerously underweight. They tend to constantly monitor their weight, avoid eating certain types of foods, and severely restrict their calorie intake.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><strong>Bulimia nervosa&nbsp;</strong></p></li>
                                    <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulimia nervosa is another well-known eating disorder.Like anorexia, bulimia tends to develop during adolescence and early adulthood and appears to be less common among men than women. People with bulimia frequently eat unusually large amounts of food in a specific period of time. Each binge eating episode usually continues until the person becomes painfully full. During a binge, the person usually feels that they cannot stop eating or control how much they are eating.<br>Binges can happen with any type of food but most commonly occur with foods the individual would usually avoid. Individuals with bulimia then attempt to purge to compensate for the calories consumed and to relieve gut discomfort.Common purging behaviors include forced vomiting, fasting, laxatives, diuretics, enemas, and excessive exercise. Symptoms may appear very similar to those of the binge eating or purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals with bulimia usually maintain a relatively typical weight rather than losing a large amount of weight.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><strong>Binge eating disorder &nbsp;</strong></p></li>
                                    <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binge eating disorder is the most prevalent form of eating disorder and one of the most common chronic illnesses among adolescents. It typically begins during adolescence and early adulthood, although it can develop later on. Individuals with this disorder have symptoms similar to those of bulimia or the binge eating subtype of anorexia. <br>For instance, they typically eat unusually large amounts of food in relatively short periods of time and feel a lack of control during binges.People with binge eating disorder do not restrict calories or use purging behaviors, such as vomiting or excessive exercise, to compensate for their binges. <br>People with binge eating disorder often consume an excessive amount of food and may not make nutritious food choices. This may increase their risk of medical complications such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes &nbsp;</span></p>
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><strong>Pica &nbsp;</strong></p></li>
                                    <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pica is an eating disorder that involves eating things that are not considered food and that do not provide nutritional value. Individuals with pica crave non-food substances such as ice, dirt, soil, chalk, soap, paper, hair, cloth, wool, pebbles, laundry detergent, or cornstarch.It is most frequently seen in individuals with conditions that affect daily functioning, including intellectual disabilities, developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, and mental health conditions such as schizophrenia <br>Individuals with pica may be at an increased risk of poisoning, infections, gut injuries, and nutritional deficiencies. Depending on the substances ingested, pica may be fatal. However, for the condition to be considered pica, the eating of non-food substances must not be a typical part of someone’s culture or religion. In addition, it must not be considered a socially acceptable practice by a person’s peers. &nbsp;</span></p>
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><strong>Rumination&nbsp;</strong></p></li>
                                    <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumination disorder is another newly recognized eating disorder. It describes a condition in which a person regurgitates food they have previously chewed and swallowed, re-chews it, and then either re-swallows it or spits it out. This rumination typically occurs within the first 30 minutes after a meal.This disorder can develop during infancy, childhood, or adulthood. In infants, it tends to develop between 3 and 12 months of age and often disappears on its own. Children and adults with the condition usually require therapy to resolve it. If not resolved in infants, rumination disorder can result in weight loss and severe malnutrition that can be fatal. Adults with this disorder may restrict the amount of food they eat, especially in public. This may lead them to lose weight and become underweight. &nbsp;</span></p>
                                <li><p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include purging disorder, night eating sndreome and Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) &nbsp;</span></p></li>

                            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Causes of Eating disorder&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating disorders are not caused by just one factor but by a combination of sociocultural, psychological, and biological factors.&nbsp;</span></p>
